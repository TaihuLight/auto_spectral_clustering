Typically spectral clustering requires number of clusters manually.

auto_spectral_clustering predict number of clusters based on the eigengap(often referred to as spectral gap).

Dependencies
========================
auto_spectral_clustering is tested under Python 3.3.5.

It requires NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
